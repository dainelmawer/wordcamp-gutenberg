# Welcome to WordCamp Cape Town!
## Gutenberg Workshop: A definitive guide to your first Gutenberg block.

Hej! 👋🏻
Glad to have you in the workshop! Today we're going to build 2, maybe 3 Gutenberg blocks (depending on how we go)
You can refer to this readme throughout the workshop in case you missed a step. I dont like "formal" workshops, so this will be super casual, no pressure.

Feel free to ask questions ☝🏻

## Getting Started
1) You'll want a fresh installation of WordPress, or a not so fresh one, either way, an environment where you can install Gutenberg and the plugin in this respository.
2) Install Gutenberg! Make sure its activated and that you dont get any errors - foundation strong should be as Yoda would say.
3) Fork or download the .zip of this repo. Its a plugin, incase you havent figured that out yet.
